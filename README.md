# Focus App

Focus App is your ultimate productivity companion, designed to help you eliminate distractions, manage time effectively, and achieve your daily tasks.
Note that this is just a simple app and does not include advanced features. 
I wrote this with a limited knowledge for a university course and I am fully aware of its over-simplicity.

## Features

- **Distraction-Free Interface**: A clean and simple design to keep you focused.
- **Task Management**: Easily create, edit, and track your to-do list.
- **Timer**: Keep track of your work/study session with the timer feature.
- **Calendar Integration**: Add events to your calendar to manage deadlines and appointments.
- **Note-Taking**: Jot down ideas and important information without leaving the app.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sinnshr/Focus-App.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Focus-App
   ```

3. **Open `Main.html` in Your Browser** to start using the app.

## Usage

- **Task Management**: Navigate to the 'Tasks' section to add or edit your tasks.
- **Timer**: Use the 'Timer' feature to keep track of your work/study session.
- **Calendar**: Access the 'Calendar' to view and manage your schedule.
- **Notes**: Go to the 'Notes' section to create and manage your notes.

## Current Flaws

- **Limited Calendar Functionality**: The calendar integration lacks advanced features like reminders and recurring events. Also it is not currently possible to store the events permanently.
- **No Mobile Optimization**: The interface is not fully optimized for mobile devices.
- **Limited Customization**: Users cannot switch among various themes or timer durations.
- **No Account System and Lack of Persistent Data Storage**: Users cannot create accounts to save and sync their data across devices. Tasks, notes, and other data do not persist between sessions.
- **Fixed Timer Interval**: Users cannot set custom time intervals for the Pomodoro timer.
- **No Built-In Music**: The app lacks the ability to play background music or focus-enhancing sounds.
  Additionally, it is not possible for the user to connect their Spotify/SoundCloud/YouTube Music (or their preferred music platform) to the app to play their favored songs.
